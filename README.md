> _"The Delta Team has developed a techno-arc system that allows optimizing and automating the illegal spell detection process; for the rapid location and capture of criminals. In addition, the new system must allow classifying processed and criminal spells sought, and generating an official list; which will be sent to all offices for distribution. Finally, the system must be able to appoint the processed spell, as established by law"_

This is a university programming project for the Algorithms and Data Structures (AyED) course.
